# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lankin

Web developer with a four-year journey in front-end web development, boasting a diverse set of skills and experiences that seamlessly merge technical expertise with creative flair, resulting in captivating and dynamic web applications.


## ReactJS 
At the core are the fundamental technologies of web development, including Javascript, ReactJS, HTML, and CSS.
In React, I specialize in crafting functional components, using JSX for intuitive UI development. I excel in state management, employing hooks for efficient logic and side effect handling. React Router is my go-to for seamless navigation in single-page applications. With a keen understanding of props and state, I ensure a cohesive and dynamic user experience.

Diving into the complexities of state management, I bring proficiency across various tools and methodologies. This encompasses harnessing the efficiency of React-Query (TenStack) for data management, leveraging the predictability of Redux, facilitating seamless navigation with React-Router along with data loading, and ensuring a streamlined user experience with Context.

Within the realm of React development, I employ a robust toolkit, utilizing npm and Vite for streamlined package management and accelerated development workflows..

## Styling

In styling, I demonstrate versatility with CSS, effectively utilizing frameworks like Tailwind, CSS-in-JS libraries such as Styled-Components, and the dynamic Material UI component library. These tools allow me to create visually appealing and responsive designs.

## 3D in Web
Elevating web development to a new dimension, I delve into the realm of 3D in Web (WebGL). Through tools like ThreeJS, React-Three-Fiber, and React-Three-Drei, coupled with experience in Blender, I bring a new layer of interactivity and engagement to web applications.

## Tools
As a collaborative developer, I depend on Git and Github for streamlined collaboration and code management. I conduct thorough API testing using tools like Postman, ensuring the robust functionality of web applications. In database management, I utilize Supabase for modern and scalable solutions.

## OS
As a front-end developer, I use both, Linux and Windows environments, showcasing versatility in my development toolkit. As a Linux enthusiast, I am proficient in Linux systems and command-line operations. With a commitment to both, Linux and Windows, I ensure smooth and efficient development across diverse operating systems.
